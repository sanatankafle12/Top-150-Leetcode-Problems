        Calculate the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of n stairs.
        
        You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
        Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways
        can you climb to the top?
        
        Args:
            n (int): Number of stairs to climb (1 <= n <= 45)
            
        Returns:
            int: Number of distinct ways to climb to the top
            
        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> solution.climbStairs(2)
            2
            >>> solution.climbStairs(3)
            3
            >>> solution.climbStairs(4)
            5
            
        Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through stairs
        Space Complexity: O(1) - uses only constant extra space
