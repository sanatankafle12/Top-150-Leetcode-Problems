        Compute the integer square root of a non-negative integer.
        
        This function returns the largest integer whose square is less than or
        equal to x. The result is truncated, not rounded.
        
        Args:
            x (int): A non-negative integer (0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1)
            
        Returns:
            int: The integer square root of x
            
        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> solution.mySqrt(4)
            2
            >>> solution.mySqrt(8)
            2
            >>> solution.mySqrt(0)
            0
            >>> solution.mySqrt(1)
            1
            
        Time Complexity: O(log x) - binary search approach
        Space Complexity: O(1) - uses only constant extra space
